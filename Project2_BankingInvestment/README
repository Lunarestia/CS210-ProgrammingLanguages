Project 2 - Banking Investment Application
# Project 2 - Banking Investment Application

This project allows input from the user to calculate how much interest will be generated over a period of time the user inputs. 
The interest is calculated based on interest rate, initial investment, how much monthly investment is added each month, and the length
of time the user wants to look at.

I would like to improve the code to be more interactive for a person who is not a programmer. I would like to integrate a java file that 
would generate a box popup with boxes for the user to input the information needed and click a button to calculate the result, rather than 
needing to run the c++ code in an IDE to make it run.

I did not run into any major issues writing this program. It did take some time to make sure everything was calculating properly and flowed
correctly. I went through and checked each section for accuracy and errors as I went to make sure it was flowing and running properly.

The skills from this project that could be taken into other projects would be the use of loops to run through the needed calculations.

I tried to make sure the code was commented properly to make the program maintainable and readable. I tried to write the code in a way
that makes it hopefully easily adaptable to other similar types of programs that would use the flow of this project to calculate needed
information.

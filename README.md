Programs written for my CS-210 "Programming Languages" course (C++) at SNHU



# Project1_Clock is broken.
It will not output correctly. It does not add time as it should and simply outputs the current time again after being told to add time.

I am not sure how to fix this, as this is the first project I have done in C++ and have had no exposure to C++ before this course.

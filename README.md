# Project1_Clock is broken.
It will not output correctly. It does not add time as it should and simply outputs the current time again after being told to add time.

I am not sure how to fix this, as this is the first project I have done in C++ and have had no exposure to C++ before this course.



# Project2_BankingInvestment

Working as intended, with the exception of first line output of "Year End Earned Interest" under "Balance and Interest With Additional Monthly Deposits" section. It is not in line with the rest of that column. 

The rest of the output is in line and everything calculates and outputs as expected.
